# Daily Standup
Filip and Nani had a daily standup. During the meeting, we addressed what Nani and Emilia had done the previous day and what the next step in the project will be. Emilia is sick and will be updated accordingly.

Today and throughout the weekend I will keep working on our booking component, mainly with the logic of what happens after you search for an available table, will keep Nani and Emilia updated with issues and so forth.

Yesterday I continued working on the admin page: able to see the bookings, edit them and save. Today I will do the delete-function for booking on the admin page.
