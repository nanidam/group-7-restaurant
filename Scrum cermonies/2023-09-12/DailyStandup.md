# Daily Standup
Yesterday we didn't have a daily stanup meeting but we kept in touch in the Teams chat. 

## Emilia
Yesterday I was not able to do assist with the project due to sickness. Since I feel a bit better today I will continue working on the booking page to the best of my ability.  

## Filip
Yesterday I was not active at all due to some commute related issues, today I will keep working on our table booking logic which Emilia has already started on. I will ask for help if it's necessary!

## Nani
Yesterday I finished the admin page; show all bookings, update a booking and delete a booking. Today I will refactor my code before creating a PR.
